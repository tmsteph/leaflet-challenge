## Challenge Instructions
This project utilizes leaflet, Javascript and D3 to visualize the earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). \
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

## Level-1: Basic Visualization
### Get the Data Set
- The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes
- The "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" data set was selected from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page
- The data was given in JSON format which was used to pull in the data for the visualization
### Import and Visualize the Data
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
- The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color
- Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color
- Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake were included when a marker is clicked
- A legend was created to provide context for the map data

## Level-2: More Data
Plot a second data set on the map above to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
- Pull in [tectonic plates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates) data set
- Visualize it along side the original set of data
- Add a number of base maps (Satellite Map, Grayscale Map, Outdoors Map and Dark Map) to choose from
- Separate out the two different data sets (earthquakes and tectonic plates) into overlays that can be turned on and off independently
- Add layer controls to the map
